# 👁️‍🗨️ Women Safety Analytics – Real-Time Gender, Emotion & Threat Detection

A real-time safety monitoring system for women that uses facial recognition, gender classification, emotion detection, and behavioral analysis to identify potential threats. This project leverages computer vision and deep learning models to analyze live video feeds and trigger alerts in high-risk scenarios.

---

## 📌 Overview

This system uses camera-based input to:
- Detect **gender** and **facial expressions**
- Identify **emotional states** such as fear or distress
- Recognize **threatening behavior** (e.g. someone following too closely or group crowding)
- Provide potential for real-time **alerts** to guardians or authorities

It is implemented using Python with OpenCV, Deep Learning models (CNNs), and reinforcement learning logic.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Facial Recognition**
- 🙍‍♀️ **Gender Classification**
- 😨 **Emotion Detection (fear, anger, sadness)**
- 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️ **Threat Detection via Proximity & Behavior**
- 📈 **Modular & Extensible Codebase**
- 🧠 Based on **DeepFace**, CNNs, RNNs, and LSTM models
